### What I learned

In this project I learned how to use multiple background images. I never thought it was necessary until this project, and didn't think it was possible when I realized what had to be done. Thankfully, such cases are easily taken care of in CSS; I learned about this from [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_backgrounds.asp).

### Continued development

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_backgrounds.asp) - This helped me learn how to use multiple background images.
