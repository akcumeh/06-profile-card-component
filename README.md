## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flex
- Mobile-first workflow
- Accessibility-inclusive workflow

### What I learned

Not much that is new. [This MDN article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing) is worthy of note, though.

### Continued development

I want to continue to make projects that are even more disability-inclusive. That would require the use of more semantic HTML5 markup.

### Useful resources

- [MDN's article on CSS ```box-sizing``` property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing) - This helped me really clear up my misunderstandings about box sizing. I find ```border-box``` most convenient for me currently.
